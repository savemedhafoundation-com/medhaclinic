# Today Work

- Updated image import paths to use `src/assets/photos/homepageImage` where needed.
- Implemented mobile-only responsive styling across the home page sections without changing desktop layouts.
- Added mobile-specific hero background image overlay; kept desktop hero image unchanged.
- Built a Flipkart-style mobile drawer menu (hamburger + overlay + slide-in) and wired it into the header.

- Updated the mobile header layout to match the provided design and swapped the mobile-only logo image.
- Reverted the temporary mobile-only "Talk to Our Team" button styling change.
